As I step out into the misty evening of Kolkata, the gentle veil of fog wraps around me, casting a mystical spell over the city. The temperature may read 29.0°C, but it feels like a sweltering 33.4°C, a reminder that the heat is still very much present, even in the midst of this eerie mist. And yet, the air is crisp and clean, with an AQI of just 3, making it a perfect night to take a stroll along the Ganges, breathing in the freshness without a care. The mist swirls around me, shrouding the city's sounds and sights, creating an intimate, peaceful atmosphere that's quintessentially Kolkata. It's nights like these that I cherish, when the city's chaos recedes and all that's left is the gentle whisper of the mist. As I walk, the city's secrets unfold before me, and I am one with the misty night #KolkataNights #MistyMagic #CityOfJoy #CleanAirBliss
